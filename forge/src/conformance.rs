//! The [`Forge`] conformance suite — the executable specification.
//!
//! # What this is for
//!
//! The `Forge` trait states its guarantees in prose: "idempotent where noted, so
//! a resuming reconcile loop can call them repeatedly without creating
//! duplicates". Prose does not fail a build.
//!
//! **This suite is the contract.** An adapter is correct when it passes. New
//! contract semantics get a case here *first*; they are not asserted in an
//! adapter-local test, because a test that lives next to one adapter cannot
//! constrain the others.
//!
//! # Why this lives in `src/`, not `tests/`
//!
//! It started in `tests/conformance.rs`. Rust integration tests are not
//! importable by other crates, so an out-of-crate adapter — geetch, and
//! eventually the recorded github/gitlab fixtures — could not run the shared
//! battery. geetch's B2 hit exactly that wall and copied all eight cases into its
//! own repo instead, which defeats the purpose: a copy drifts, and an adapter
//! that passes its own copy has proved nothing about the shared contract.
//!
//! So the suite is a library module behind the non-default `testing` feature —
//! the same reasoning that put [`crate::testing::FakeForge`] there rather than
//! under `#[cfg(test)]`, applied one level up.
//!
//! # How to run it against a new adapter
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use forge::conformance::Fixture;
//!
//! struct MyFixture { /* connection state */ }
//! impl Fixture for MyFixture { /* forge(), repo() */ }
//!
//! forge::conformance_suite!(my_adapter, MyFixture::new());
//! ```
//!
//! That single invocation is the whole integration. An adapter that cannot
//! support a method should fail loudly here rather than silently returning a
//! plausible default — see [`unsupported_is_explicit`].
//!
//! Two requirements on the consumer: depend on `forge` with the `testing`
//! feature enabled, and have `tokio` available with the `macros` and `rt`
//! features — the generated cases are `#[tokio::test]`, so the attribute is
//! resolved in the CONSUMER's crate, not this one.
